# A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python.

Python is a very convenient language for implementing scientific
computations as the code can be made very close to the mathematical
algorithms. However, the execution speed of the code is significantly
lower than what can be obtained by programming in languages such as
Fortran, C, or C++. These languages *compile* the program to
machine language, which enables the computing resources to be utilized
with very high efficiency.  Frequently, and this includes almost all
examples in the present book, Python is fast enough. But in the cases
where speed really matters, can we increase the efficiency without
rewriting the whole program in Fortran, C, or C++? The answer is yes,
which will be illustrated through a case study in the forthcoming text.

Fortunately, Python was initially designed for being integrated with
C. This feature has spawned the development of several techniques and
tools for calling compiled languages from Python, allowing us to
relatively easily reuse fast and well-tested scientific libraries in
Fortran, C, or C++ from Python, *or* migrate slow Python code to
compiled languages. It often turns out that only smaller parts of the
code, usually \emp{for} loops doing heavy numerical computations,
suffer from low speed and can benefit from being implemented in
Fortran, C, or C++.

The primary technique to be advocated here is to use Cython.  Cython
can be viewed as an extension of the Python language where variables
can be declared with a type and other information such that Cython is
able to automatically generate special-purpose, fast C code from the
Python code. We will show how to utilize Cython and what the
computational gain might be.

The present case study starts with stating a computational
problem involving statistical simulations, which are known
to cause long execution times,
especially if accurate results are desired.

# #else

Monte Carlo simulations are usually known to require long execution
times. Implementing such simulations in pure Python may lead to
inefficient code.  The purpose of this note is to show how Python
implementations of Monte Carlo simulations, can be made much more
efficient by porting the code to Cython. Pure C implementations are
included for comparison of efficiency. The reader should know about
basic Python and perhaps a bit about Monte Carlo simulations.  Cython
will be introduced in a step-by-step fashion

======= Pure Python Code for Monte Carlo Simulation =======

A short, intuitive algorithm in Python is first developed.
Then this code is vectorized using functionality of the Numerical
Python package. Later sections migrate the algorithm to Cython
code and also plain C code for comparison. At the end the various
techniques are ranked according to their computational efficiency.

===== The Computational Problem =====

A die is thrown $m$ times.
What is the probability of getting six eyes *at least* $n$ times?
For example, if $m=5$ and $n=3$, this is the same as asking for
the probability that three or more out of five dice show six eyes.

The probability can be estimated by Monte Carlo simulation.
# #ifdef PRIMER_BOOK
Chapter ref{sec:random:probability} provides a background
for this technique:
# #endif
We simulate the process a large number of times, $N$, and count how
many times, $M$, the experiment turned out successfully, i.e., when we
got at least $n$ out of $m$ dice with six eyes in a throw.

Monte Carlo simulation has traditionally been viewed as a very costly
computational method, normally requiring very sophisticated, fast
computer implementations in compiled languages.  An interesting
question is how useful high-level languages like Python and associated
tools are for Monte Carlo simulation. This will now be explored.


===== A Scalar Python Implementation =====

Let us introduce the more descriptive variables `ndice` for $m$
and `nsix` for $n$. The Monte Carlo method is
simply a loop, repeated `N` times, where the body of the loop may
directly express the problem at hand. Here, we draw `ndice` random
integers `r` in $[1,6]$ inside the loop and count of many (`six`) that
equal 6. If `six >= nsix`, the experiment is a success and we increase
the counter `M` by one.

A Python function implementing this approach may look as follows:

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6.py fromto: import random@def dice6_vec1

The `float(M)` transformation is important since `M/N` will imply integer
division when `M` and `N` both are integers in Python v2.x and many other
languages.

We will refer to this implementation is the *plain Python* implementation.
Timing the function can be done by:
!bc pycod
import time
t0 = time.clock()
p = dice6_py(N, ndice, nsix)
t1 = time.clock()
print 'CPU time for loops in Python:', t1-t0
!ec
The table to appear later shows the performance of this plain, pure Python
code relative to other approaches. There is a factor of 30+ to be
gained in computational efficiency by reading on.

The function above can be verified by studying the (somewhat
simplified) case $m=n$ where the probability becomes $6^{-n}$. The
probability quickly becomes small with increasing $n$.  For such small
probabilities the number of successful events $M$ is small, and $M/N$
will not be a good approximation to the probability unless $M$ is
reasonably large, which requires a very large $N$. For example, with
$n=4$ and $N=10^5$ the average probability in 25 full Monte Carlo
experiments is 0.00078 while the exact answer is 0.00077. With
$N=10^6$ we get the two correct significant digits from the Monte
Carlo simulation, but the extra digit costs a factor of 10 in
computing resources since the CPU time scales linearly with $N$.


#3 dice, N=10^3, mean=0.00376, stdev=1.82e-03, exact=0.00463, time=0.0 s
#3 dice, N=10^4, mean=0.00479, stdev=5.14e-04, exact=0.00463, time=0.1 s
#3 dice, N=10^5, mean=0.00469, stdev=2.24e-04, exact=0.00463, time=0.8 s

#4 dice, N=10^3, mean=0.00060, stdev=6.32e-04, exact=0.00077, time=0.0 s

#5 dice, N=10^4, mean=0.00011, stdev=1.07e-04, exact=0.00013, time=0.1 s
#5 dice, N=10^5, mean=0.00013, stdev=3.72e-05, exact=0.00013, time=1.3 s
#5 dice, N=10^6, mean=0.00013, stdev=9.85e-06, exact=0.00013, time=12.8 s


===== A Vectorized Python Implementation =====

A vectorized version of the previous program consists of replacing the
explicit loops in Python by efficient operations on vectors or arrays,
using functionality in the Numerical Python (`numpy`) package.
Each array operation takes place in C or Fortran and is hence
much more efficient than the corresponding loop version in Python.

First, we must generate all the random numbers to be used in one
operation, which runs fast since all numbers are then calculated in
efficient C code. This is accomplished using the `numpy.random`
module.  Second, the analysis of the large collection of random
numbers must be done by appropriate vector/array operations such that
no looping in Python is needed. The solution algorithm must therefore
be expressed through a series of function calls to the `numpy` library.
Vectorization requires knowledge of the library's functionality and
how to assemble the relevant building blocks to an algorithm without
operations on individual array elements.

Generation of `ndice` random number of eyes for `N` experiments is
performed by
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
eyes = np.random.random_integers(1, 6, size=(N, ndice))
!ec
Each row in the `eyes` array corresponds to one Monte Carlo experiment.

The next step is to count the number of successes in each experiment.
This counting should not make use of any loop.  Instead we can test
`eyes == 6` to get a boolean array where an element `i,j` is `True` if
throw (or die) number `j` in Monte Carlo experiment number `i` gave
six eyes.  Summing up the rows in this boolean array (`True` is interpreted
as 1 and `False` as 0), we are
interested in the rows where the sum is equal to or greater than
`nsix`, because the number of such rows equals the number of
successful events. The vectorized algorithm can be expressed as

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6.py fromto: def dice6_vec1@def dice6_vec2

The use of `np.sum` instead of Python's own `sum` function is
essential for the speed of this function: using `M = sum(nsucccesses)`
instead slows down the code by a factor of almost 10!  We shall refer
to the `dice6_vec1` function as the *vectorized Python, version1*
implementation.

The criticism against the vectorized version is that the original
problem description, which was almost literally turned into Python
code in the `dice6_py` function, has now become much more
complicated. We have to decode the calls to various
`numpy` functionality to actually realize that `dice6_py`
and `dice6_vec` correspond to the same mathematics.

Here is another possible vectorized algorithm, which is easier to
understand, because we retain the Monte Carlo loop and vectorize only
each individual experiment:

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6.py fromto: def dice6_vec2@def experiment

We refer to this implementation as *vectorized Python, version 2*.  As
will be shown later, this implementation is significantly slower than
the *plain Python* implementation (!) and very much slower than the
*vectorized Python, version 1* approach.  A conclusion is that
readable, partially vectorized code, may run slower than
straightforward scalar code.

======= Migrating Scalar Python Code to Cython =======

===== A Plain Cython Implementation =====

A Cython program starts with the scalar Python implementation, but all
variables are specified with their types, using Cython's variable
declaration syntax, like `cdef int M = 0` where we in standard Python
just write `M = 0`.  Adding such variable declarations in the scalar
Python implementation is straightforward:

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6.pyx fromto: import random@import  numpy

This code must be put in a separate file with extension `.pyx`.
Running Cython on this file translates the Cython code to C.
Thereafter, the C code must be compiled and linked to form a
shared library, which can be imported in Python as a module.  All
these tasks are normally automated by a `setup.py` script.  Let the
`dice6_cy1` function above be stored in a file `dice6.pyx`.  A proper
`setup.py` script looks as follows:

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/setup_cy.py

Running
!bc sys
Terminal> python setup.py build_ext --inplace
!ec
generates the C code and creates a (shared library)
file `_dice6_cy.so` (known as a *C extension module*) which
can be loaded into Python as a module with name `_dice6_cy`:
!bc pycod
from _dice6_cy import dice6_cy1
import time
t0 = time.clock()
p = dice6_cy1(N, ndice, nsix)
t1 = time.clock()
print t1 - t0
!ec
We refer to this implementation as *Cython random.randint*.
Although most of the statements in the `dice6_cy1` function
are turned into plain and fast C code,
the speed is not much improved compared with the original scalar
Python code.

To investigate what takes time in this Cython implementation, we can perform
a profiling. The template for profiling a Python function whose
call syntax is stored in some string `statement`, reads
!bc pycod
import cProfile, pstats
cProfile.runctx(statement, globals(), locals(), 'tmp_profile.dat')
s = pstats.Stats('tmp_profile.dat')
s.strip_dirs().sort_stats('time').print_stats(30)
!ec
Data from the profiling are here stored in the file `tmp_profile.dat`.
Our interest now is the `dice6_cy1` function so we set
!bc pycod
statement = 'dice6_cy1(N, ndice, nsix)'
!ec
In addition, a Cython file in which there are functions we want to
profile must start with the line
!bc cycod
# cython: profile=True
!ec
to turn on profiling when creating the extension module.
The profiling output from the present example looks like
!bc dat
       5400004 function calls in 7.525 CPU seconds

 Ordered by: internal time

 ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
1800000    4.511    0.000    4.863    0.000 random.py:160(randrange)
1800000    1.525    0.000    6.388    0.000 random.py:224(randint)
      1    1.137    1.137    7.525    7.525 dice6.pyx:6(dice6_cy1)

      1    0.000    0.000    7.525    7.525 {dice6_cy.dice6_cy1}
!ec
We easily see that it is the call to `random.randint` that consumes
almost all the time. The reason is that the generated C code must
call a Python module (`random`), which implies a lot of overhead. The C code
should only call plain C functions, or if Python functions *must*
be called, they should involve so much computations that the overhead
in calling Python from C is negligible.

Instead of profiling the code to uncover inefficient constructs we
can generate a visual representation of how the Python code is
translated to C. Running
!bc sys
Terminal> cython -a dice6.pyx
!ec
creates a file `dice6.html` which can be loaded into a web browser
to inspect what Cython has done with the Python code.

FIGURE:[fig-MC_cython/dice6_html.png, width=550]

White lines indicate that the Python code is translated into C code, while
the yellow lines indicate that the generated C code must make calls
back to Python (using the Python C API, which implies overhead). Here,
the `random.randint` call is in yellow, so this call is
not translated to efficient C code.

===== A Better Cython Implementation =====

To speed up the previous Cython code, we have to get rid of the
`random.randint` call every time we need a random variable.  Either we
must call some C function for generating a random variable or we must
create a bunch of random numbers simultaneously as we did in the
vectorized functions shown above. We first try the latter well-known
strategy and apply the `numpy.random` module to generate all the
random numbers we need at once:
!bc cycod
import  numpy as np
cimport numpy as np

cdef np.ndarray[np.int_t,
                ndim=2,
                negative_indices=False,
                mode='c'] eyes = \
                np.random.random_integers(1, 6, (N, ndice))
!ec
This code needs some explanation. The `cimport` statement imports
a special version of `numpy` for Cython and is needed *after* the
standard `numpy` import. The declaration of the array of
random numbers could just go as
!bc cycod
cdef np.ndarray eyes = np.random.random_integers(1, 6, (N, ndice))
!ec
However, the processing of the `eyes` array will then be slow because
Cython does not have enough information about the array. To generate
optimal C code, we must provide information on the element types
in the array, the number of dimensions of the array, that the array
is stored in contiguous memory, and that we do not need negative
indices (which slows down array indexing). All this information
is inserted in square brackets: `np.int_t` denotes integer array
elements (`np.int` is the usual data type object, but `np.int_t` is
a Cython precompiled version of this object), `ndim=2` tells
that the array has two dimensions (indices),
`negative_indices=False` turns off the possibility for negative indices
(counting from the end),
and `mode='c'` indicates contiguous storage of the array.
We also insert a line `@cython.boundscheck(False)` at the line before
the function to tell Cython to turn off the costly check that array
indices stay within their bounds.
With all this extra information, Cython can generate C code that
works with `numpy` arrays as efficiently as native C arrays.

The rest of the code is a plain copy of the `dice6_py` function, but
with the `random.randint` call replaced by an array look-up
`eyes[i,j]` to retrieve the next random number.  The two loops will
now be as efficient as if they were coded directly in pure C.

The complete code for the efficient version of the `dice6_cy1` function
looks as follows:

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6.pyx fromto: import  numpy@from libc
This Cython implementation is named *Cython numpy.random*.

The disadvantage with the `dice6_cy2` function is that large simulations
(large `N`) also require large amounts of memory, which usually limits
the possibility for high accuracy much more than the CPU time. It would
be advantageous to have a fast random number generator a la
`random.randint` in C. The C library `stdlib` has a generator of
random integers, `rand()`, generating numbers from 0 to up `RAND_MAX`.
Both the `rand` function and the `RAND_MAX` integer are easy to
access in a Cython program:
!bc cycod
from libc.stdlib cimport rand, RAND_MAX

r = 1 + int(rand()/(RAND_MAX*6.0)) # random integer 1,...,6
!ec
Note that `rand()` returns an integer so we must avoid integer
division by ensuring that the denominator is a real number. We also
need to explicitly convert the resulting real fraction to `int`
since `r` is declared as `int`.

With this way of generating random numbers we can create a version of
`dice6_cy1` that is as fast as `dice6_cy`, but avoids all the memory
demands and the somewhat complicated array declarations of the latter:

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6.pyx fromto: from libc@
This final Cython implementation will be referred to as *Cython stdlib.rand*.

======= Migrating Code to C =======

===== Writing a C Program =====

A natural next improvement would be to program the Monte Carlo
simulation loops directly in a compiled programming language, which
guarantees optimal speed. Here we choose the C programming
language for this purpose.
The C version of our `dice6` function and an associated main program
take the form

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6_c.c

This code is placed in a file `dice6_c.c`.
The file can typically be compiled and run by
!bc sys
Terminal> gcc -O3 -o dice6.capp dice6_c.c
Terminal> ./dice6.capp 1000000
!ec
This solution is later referred to as *C program*.

===== Migrating Loops to C Code via F2PY =====

Instead of programming the whole application in C, we may consider
migrating the loops to the C function `dice6` shown above and then
have the rest of the program (essentially the calling main program) in
Python. This is a convenient solution if we were to do many other,
less CPU-time critical things for convenience in Python.

There are many alternative techniques for calling C functions from
Python. Here we shall explain two. The first applies the program
`f2py` to generate the necessary code that glues Python and C.
The `f2py` program was actually made for gluing Python and Fortran,
but it can work with C too. We need a specification of the C
function to call in terms of a Fortran 90 module. Such a module can
be written by hand, but `f2py` can also generate it. To this end,
we make a Fortran file `dice6_c_signature.f`
with the signature of the C function written
in Fortran 77 syntax with some annotations:

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6_c_signature.f

The annotations `intent(c)` are necessary to tell `f2py` that the
Fortran variables are to be treated as plain C variables and
not as pointers (which is the default interpretation of variables
in Fortran). The `C2fpy` are special comment lines that `f2py`
recognizes, and these lines are used to provide extra information
to `f2py` which have no meaning in plain Fortran 77.

We must run `f2py` to generate a `.pyf` file with a Fortran 90
module specification of the C function to call:
!bc sys
Terminal> f2py -m _dice6_c1 -h dice6_c.pyf \
          dice6_c_signature.f
!ec
Here `_dice6_c1` is the name of the module with the C function
that is to be imported in Python, and `dice6_c.pyf` is the
name of the Fortran 90 module file to be generated. Programmers
who know Fortran 90 may want to write the `dice6_c.pyf` file
by hand.

The next step is to use the information in `dice6_c.pyf`
to generate a (C extension) module `_dice6_c1`. Fortunately,
`f2py` generates the necessary code, and compiles and links the relevant
files, to form a shared library file `_dice6_c1.so`, by a short command:
!bc sys
Terminal> f2py -c dice6_c.pyf dice6_c.c
!ec
We can now test the module:
!bc ipy
>>> import _dice6_c1
>>> print dir(_dice6_c1)  # module contents
['__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__',
 '__version__', 'dice6']
>>> print _dice6_c1.dice6.__doc__
dice6 - Function signature:
  dice6 = dice6(n,ndice,nsix)
Required arguments:
  n : input int
  ndice : input int
  nsix : input int
Return objects:
  dice6 : float
>>> _dice6_c1.dice6(N=1000, ndice=4, nsix=2)
0.145
!ec
The method of calling the C function `dice6` via an `f2py`
generated module is referred to as *C via f2py*.

===== Migrating Loops to C Code via Cython =====

The Cython tool can also be used to call C code, not only generating
C code from the Cython language.
Our C code is in the file `dice6_c.c`, but for Cython to
see this code we need to create a *header file* `dice6_c.h`
listing the definition of the function(s) we want to call from Python.
The header file takes the form

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6_c.h

The next step is to make a `.pyx` file with a definition of the C
function from the header file and a Python function that calls
the C function:

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/dice6_cwrap.pyx

Cython must use this file, named `dice6_cwrap.pyx`,
to generate C code, which is to be compiled and linked with
the `dice6_c.c` code. All this is accomplished in a `setup.py`
script:

@@@CODE src-MC_cython/setup_c.py
This `setup.py` script is run as
!bc sys
Terminal> python setup.py build_ext --inplace
!ec
resulting in a shared library file `_dice6_c2.so`, which can
be loaded into Python as a module:
!bc ipy
>>> import _dice6_c2
>>> print dir(_dice6_c2)
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__',
 '__package__', '__test__', 'dice6_cwrap']
!ec
We see that the module contains the function `dice6_cwrap`, which
was made to call the underlying C function `dice6`.

===== Comparing Efficiency =====

All the files corresponding to the various techniques described above
are available
# #ifdef PRIMER_BOOK
in the directory `src/cython`.
# #else
as a "tarball": "_static/MC_cython.tar.gz" or accessible
from through the GitHub project "`MC_cython`": "https://github.com/hplgit/MC_cython".
# #endif
A file `make.sh` performs all the compilations, while `compare.py`
runs all methods and prints out the CPU time required by each method,
normalized by the fastest approach. The results for $N=450,000$
are listed below (MacBook Air
running Ubuntu in a VMWare Fusion virtual machine).

| vectorized Python, version 2  | 105.0  |
|----------------------------------------|

The CPU time of the plain Python version was 10 s, which is reasonably
fast for obtaining a fairly accurate result in this problem.  The
lesson learned is therefore that a Monte Carlo simulation can be
implemented in plain Python first. If more speed is needed, one can
just add type information and create a Cython code. Studying the HTML
file with what Cython manages to translate to C may give hints about
how successful the Cython code is and point to optimizations, like
avoiding the call to `random.randint` in the present case. Optimal
Cython code runs here at approximately the same speed as calling a
handwritten C function with the time-consuming loops.  It is
to be noticed that the stand-alone C program here ran faster than
calling C from Python, probably because the amount of calculations is
not large enough to make the overhead of calling C negligible.

Vectorized Python do give a great speed-up compared to plain
loops in Python, if done correctly, but the efficiency is not on par
with Cython or handwritten C. Even more important is the fact that
vectorized code is not at all as readable as the algorithm expressed
in plain Python, Cython, or C. Cython therefore provides a very
attractive combination of readability, ease of programming, and high
speed.


#If the speed is
#not acceptable, go for Cython rather than vectorization.  With Cython,
#generate all the random numbers at once and introduce simple loops
#that fetch all random numbers from an array.  Such loops and array
#loop-ups can be successfully turned into fast C code by
#Cython. Vectorized versions suffer from two major shortcomings in this
#example: the gain in speed is modest and the close correspondance
#between the original problem formulation and the code in the body of
#the Monte Carlo loop is lost.
